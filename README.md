## :robot: Overview

**A House Divided** is a browser-based political simulation where players create politicians, compete in elections, form coalitions, pass legislation, and climb from state office to national leadership. The game runs on a turn-based economy (1 turn = 1 real hour) with persistent world state across the US and UK.

This repository contains the **Discord bot** — a companion app that connects to the game's API and exposes live game data via slash commands, so players can check standings, elections, and news without switching to a browser.

## :robot: Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v20 or later
- **npm** v10 or later
- A Discord bot token and application from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- **Server Members Intent** enabled in the Discord Developer Portal (Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents) — required for the welcome message flow
- A valid `GAME_API_KEY` from A House Divided

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Egg3901/adhd-bot.git
cd adhd-bot

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy and fill in environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Your Discord bot token |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` | Your Discord application client ID |
| `GAME_API_URL` | Game API base URL (default: `https://www.ahousedividedgame.com/`) |
| `GAME_API_KEY` | API key for the game backend |
| `WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID` | Channel ID where welcome messages are sent to new members |
| `RULES_CHANNEL_ID` | Channel ID linked in the welcome message |
| `MEMBER_ROLE_ID` | Role ID assigned by `/accept` |

### Development

```bash
# Run in watch mode (auto-reloads on file changes)
npm run dev
```

### Register Slash Commands

Commands must be registered with Discord before they appear in servers. Run once per deployment or after adding new commands:

```bash
npm run register
```

### Production Build

```bash
# Compile TypeScript to dist/
npm run build

# Run compiled output
npm start
```

---

## :robot: Deployment (Oracle Cloud / Ubuntu)

### First-time Setup

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

This installs Node.js, PM2, builds the project, registers commands, and starts the bot under PM2 with startup persistence.

### Updating

```bash
bash scripts/deploy.sh
```

Pulls latest changes, rebuilds, and restarts the PM2 process.

### PM2 Commands

```bash
pm2 status              # Check bot status
pm2 logs adhd-bot       # View live logs
pm2 restart adhd-bot    # Manual restart
```

---

## :robot: Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests (pure utility and formatting functions)
npm test

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

33 unit tests cover `hexToInt`, `errorMessage`, `getMetricValue`, `ideologyLabel`, `formatElectionType`, and `formatOfficeType`. No mocking required — all tested functions are pure input/output.

---

## :robot: Code Style & Linting

After installing dependencies, run:

```bash
# Check for lint errors
npm run lint

# Auto-fix where possible
npm run lint:fix
```
